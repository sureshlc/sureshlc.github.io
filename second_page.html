    <h1>Reasons for Occurrence and Symptoms of Cervical Cancer</h1>
    <p>Cervical cancer can often be found early and sometimes even prevented by having regular screening tests.</p>
    <p>Almost all cervical cancer cases are linked to infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), and effective primary (HPV vaccination) and secondary prevention approaches will prevent most cervical cancer cases.</p>
    <p>Symptoms of cervical cancer include vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal bleeding, vaginal odor, and pain. It's important to see a doctor if experiencing any of these symptoms.</p>
