        After a considerable hiatus, I find myself compelled to put pen to paper and articulate the tumult of thoughts within me. Your presence in my life, though brief, left an indelible mark. Never did I anticipate such brevity. In the customary trajectory of arranged marriages, the initial years are dedicated to understanding one's partner, followed by the arrival of children. Our journey seemed to follow this pattern seamlessly. As we embraced the notion of a blissful family unit, fate intervened abruptly.

Sudha harbored a long-standing desire for a place to call our own, and after extensive deliberation, we finally secured a home. Together, we poured our hearts into transforming mere walls into a sanctuary. Our initial year in our newfound abode was filled with joy. However, the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic forced the world indoors, and we found ourselves adapting to remote work within the confines of our home. Little did Sudha know that her time in this haven would be tragically short-lived.

The unraveling began on September 26thâ€”a date forever etched in my memory. Sudha began experiencing excruciating back pain and persistent bleeding, prompting online consultations amidst the prevailing fear of Covid. A sense of foreboding gnawed at me. By November 10th, Sudha's mother succumbed to illness, leaving us reeling. Witnessing Sudha's father grappling with the tragedy only compounded our anguish.

In a mere 20 days, our lives took a darker turn. A visit to the gynecologist culminated in a referral to a cancer hospital. Within a week, our world was turned upside down as Sudha received a devastating diagnosis: Stage 2B cervical cancer. Her reaction, stoic yet tinged with a mother's concern for her child's future, remains vivid in my mind. Despite undergoing radiation and a milder chemotherapy regimen, Sudha remained steadfast in her responsibilities, never faltering in her duties or her commitment to work.

Eight fleeting months remained, during which I cherished every moment with her. She spent 42 days in the ICU, tethered to a ventilator. I recall her unwavering spirit, demanding her laptop to tend to work even in the face of adversity. Her resilience was both inspiring and humbling. In her final days, her sole wish was to behold our child, a wish I fulfilled two days before her passing. The sight of her smile, albeit frail, brought a fleeting sense of solace amidst the prevailing despair.

Our marriage, like many others, was a tapestry woven with both joyous moments and trials. Reflecting on our journey fills me with a profound sense of remorse. Now, adrift in a sea of solitude, I find myself bereft of companionship. The mere thought of religion and divine providence leaves me feeling suffocated, particularly considering Sudha's tumultuous upbringing. Despite her unwavering contentment with life's offerings, I find myself grappling with existential questions and self-blame.

Unable to unburden myself emotionally before my elderly parents or our tender-hearted child, I navigate this tumultuous terrain alone. The world outside appears alien and unforgiving, exacerbating my sense of isolation. I am mired in self-doubt and devoid of motivation for the future. Each passing day feels like an insurmountable hurdle, and social interactions only serve to deepen my anguish.

In the depths of despair, I find solace in memories of Sudha's resilience and unwavering spirit. Though she may have departed this world, her legacy endures, a beacon of strength in my darkest hours.
