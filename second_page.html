        After a long time I thought of writing down the thoughts running through me. You came into my life and swiftly went out and never thought this would be so short. The initial few years of a marriage typically arranged marriages goes off in understanding their partners and then next few years with the arrival of kid. It was when we both felt we have our so called happy family with kid, all things tumbled down so fast. Sudha had for long time wanted to live in a own house and after long discussions we went ahead and got our home. We both put our full efforts to make the four walls into a sweet home. We moved in and had a happy time for nearly an year. Covid pandemic made the whole world to stay close inside the house and we too started completely working from him. Little she knew that she would be in that home for only another year. Guess it was destined that if Covid wasnt there , she might have spent less time at home. It all started in September 26th, still I remember the date and day. Just the rememberance of the date brings tears to my eyes. Sudha started having severe back pains, bleeding which didnt stop. Fearing Corona did online consultations without knowing what we was really coming to us. Some how my inner self was giving some negative signs. November 10th Sudha's mother passed away within one day of hospitalisation. We both went to vijayawada and seeing the state of the situation, her dad who was not in any state to comprehend the situation I felt miserable. Dont know how worse it would have hit her. Just in another 20 days things changed more worse, we went to gyneacolist and she asked us to visit an cancer hospital. Just within  week things were upside down. Sudha was diagonised with Cervical cancer stage 2b. I still remember what she told immediately after knowing this, "It could have after 5yr by which kid would have been little older(she was 8yr when this happened)". She didnt regret for getting but just wanted sometime for kid to be little older. Sudha was more mature and compose in any situation unlike me, I miss her for this a lot. Radiation and lighter chemotherapy regime was recommended and she went through that. All through she worked and never missed for doing her tasks and she was even more involved in work. Another 8months is all she had and all I had to spend time with her. Was in ICU for 42 days and on ventilator. I remember she saying "Feeling bored, get me my laptop wot work" another instance she said "these people cant do anything to me", "Take me home we can come back in another few days to hospital", "Kid birthday would be coming would I be back home then".Two days before her death some inner thought made me to take kid to hospital to show to her. The smile in her face after seeing kid , I saw her in that state after nearly 2 months. She was so happy to see the kid. Felt some good feeling after so many days and gave hope. But next two days she never opened her eyes and didnt respond to us when we spoke to her. Guess her last wish was to see the kid and she closed her eyes to sleep into the eternal sleep after that.<br><br>

        Not every marriage is just filled with roses, we have had our part of misunderstanding and happiness moments and so. Thinking all through the same just feel sick of myself. Now many times I feel being lonely, no one to share my thoughts making me more worse for myself. Just going away from the so called God and religion  and feel suffocated when i think of these. Sudha had went though a lot in her childhood and college days in terms financial instability. She was always content with what was there unlike me always. Some times this human brain tries to reason why all these happened(even though she never asked that), and finding no cause it makes me to blame myself. I Am in a state who cant express emotionally infront of my elederly parents and kid who is just 10yr. Seeing the world I feel sick, why I cant have a family. Nowadays social meetings make me more difficult to handle. I have screwed up my life to the full extent. Dont get any motivation in the future and dont get compulsion to stay ahead. It just feels all terrible.
