    <h1>Basic Information about Cervical Cancer</h1>
    <p>Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer, with almost all cases linked to high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV).</p>
    <p>It develops in a woman's cervix, and almost always caused by HPV, which is transmitted through sexual contact.</p>
    <p>Rates of cervical cancer have gone down in the United States, and low-cost screening is available through CDCâ€™s National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.</p>
