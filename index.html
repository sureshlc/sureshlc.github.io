    <h1>In Memory of Sudha</h1>
    <img src="sudha_image.jpg" alt="Sudha">
    <p>
        Sudha, a name like honeyed wine,<br>
        Sweet on the tongue, yet tinged with brine.<br>
        Your smile, a beacon in the night,<br>
        Now a memory, bittersweet and bright.<br><br>

        Sundays linger, ghosts of bliss,<br>
        Two chairs remain, where one you'd miss.<br>
        Laughter's echo, faint and frail,<br>
        Haunts the space, a whispered tale.<br><br>

        In every knot, a story told,<br>
        Of strands you bound, love to behold.<br>
        But now, they hold a poignant sting,<br>
        Of what was lost, on fleeting wing.<br><br>

        Peaceful slumber, but hearts still ache,<br>
        For words unspoken, love to wake.<br>
        The sun may rise, the spirit roam,<br>
        Yet absence chills, a hollow home.<br><br>

        Though bittersweet, our love won't fade,<br>
        In fading light, a promise made.<br>
        Memories dance, a bittersweet refrain,<br>
        Sudha, forever loved, forever in my heart you'll remain.
